# LIBRA

LIBRA is a comprehensive, multi-dimensional network optimization framework. By
considering an array of target DNN models, network shapes, and design constraints, LIBRA optimizes either
end-to-end execution performance or network/system performance-per-cost. After the optimization process,
LIBRA yields a workload-aware BW configuration meeting all given design constraints.

Below figure summarizes the high-level overview of the LIBRA framework:
